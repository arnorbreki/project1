										<p>
											3D printing and 3D scanning
										</p>
                                    </header>
									<p>
                                        The purpose for this project was for students to get familiar with 3D printing and scanning, learn about the options and barriers of 3D printing and learn the basics about 3D scanning. 
                                        For this project I wanted to 3D print something that would be useful. In one of my classes at the university, Mechatronics we were building a robot that could give a sip of wine and for that project I needed something that could grab a wine glass and serve someone. So I decided to print a robotic claw that would be controlled by a servo motor. But before starting on the design I needed to study the options and barriers of the 3D printers at Fablab.
                                          <header>
											<h3>3D printing barriers</h3>
										</header>
                                    <p>
                                            I grouped up with my fellow students Valgeir, Sverrir and Halldór to test one of the printers in Fablab. We decided to print a little test that could give us an simple idea of the barriers for 3D printing. We selected Prusa i3 MK3S for the test and on <a href="https://valgeir99.github.io/valgeir/3d_printing.html">Valgeir's website </a>you can read all about the barriers that follow 3D printing with this printer. With those barriers in mind I started my design. 
                                  </p>
                                      
                                      <header>
											<h3>Modeling in Fusion</h3>
										</header>
                                     <a href="#" class="image2 featured"><img src="images/klo.png" alt="" /></a>
                                   <p> The claw needed to be able to grab a wine glass, hold it and then rotate it to pure the wine. The claw needed to be designed so that the servo motor could fit perfictly into the claw and control it. At the other end of the claw I was going to fit a metal bar that would be connectet to a stepper motor that could rotate the claw and give a sip of the wine.            </p>
                                       <a href="#" class="image2 featured"><img src="images/klo1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                    
                                    One of the barriers of 3D printing is time. With that in mind I designed the claw as simple as possible. Mostly sharp edges and simple forms.
                                           
                                
                                    <a href="#" class="image2 featured"><img src="images/klo2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                    The design was made out of two parts, one stationary and one moving part. 

                                    <a href="#" class="image2 featured"><img src="images/klo3.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                     
                                         <a href="#" class="image2 featured"><img src="images/klo4.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                        
                                                                        <header>
											<h3>The manufacturing</h3>
										</header>
                                    I saved the design as .stl file in Fusion and opened in <a href="https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura">Cura.  </a>Because I was printing my part in the Prusa i3 M35 I needed to open my .stl file in Fablab's computer because the free version of Cura does not have the settings for Prusa i3. I placed my parts in Cura and changed some settings. One of the barriers we saw in the 3D test was bridging. I therefore selected support for my print. I also selected 40% infill for strenght, that means that solid parts of the print are 40% filled with plastic. This was really important because I didn't want my claw to brake while serving someone wine. Then I sliced my part in Cura and saved the file as a G code and moved with a SD card to the Prusa printer. 
                                      <a href="#" class="image2 featured"><img src="images/settings.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                     <a href="#" class="image2 featured"><img src="images/klo6.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                    The print took around 4 hours to complete. On the photo below you can see how the support setting make a fill under the bridge for support. After the print I used some tools to remove the support. And my robotic claw was ready!
                                    <a href="#" class="image2 featured"><img src="images/klo5.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                     <a href="#" class="image2 featured"><img src="images/servo.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                    The robot that served wine, measured the tempeture of the wine and determined if the wine was red wine or white wine.
                                    <a href="#" class="image2 featured"><img src="images/robot.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                  
                                  
                                        
                                        <div>

											<h3>3D scanning</h3>
                                        
										</header>
                                            <p> I began the 3D scanning part of this project by watching some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYM7uZeiXH0">videos </a>and read some <a href="https://www.instructables.com/3d-Scan-Anything-Using-Just-a-Camera/">articles </a>about how to 3D scan an object. I decided to 3D scan my new Nike Airforce shoe. I placed my shoe on a chess board and placed the chess board in the middle of the floor at my home. As can be seen in the video and the article the things and light surrounding the object can be a major factor in the scan. <a href="#" class="image2 featured"><img src="images/skor1.JPG" alt="" /></a>
                                                I took 100 photos, moved 30 degress after each photo in a circle around my shoe. I did couple of those loops with an different angle. Then I uploaded the photos into Autodesk Recap photo which is a limited application that builds a 3D model from your pictures. The application is limited up to 100 photos for each object and because it's cloud based program the time for the program to process the photos can take from 1 hour up to 24 hours. 
                                                
                                            </p>
                                                     <header>
											<h3>Post processing</h3>
										</header>
                                            <p>After waiting for my model to be ready I needed to clean up my model. I whatched this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMfnHAJPw_w&ab_channel=itsaCADworld">video </a>on how to process the model and how to remove every other part that I didn't want. 
                                                 <a href="#" class="image2 featured"><img src="images/recap1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                                I used the selection box to select everything I didn´t want in my model and deleted it. 
                                                 <a href="#" class="image2 featured"><img src="images/recap2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                                I then selected the slice and fill feature that allowed my to remove the chess board from the shoe. I then selected the bottom of the shoe and filled up the hole that came with the model. Then I went to analyze->detect and fix model issue and fixed some little errors in the mesh. After some post processing my model was ready. I was quite happy with the outcome. The only problem I notice was inside the shoe. The program was not sure what to do with the gap where your foot is supose to go in but I think that that is an normal error for such a complex form.
